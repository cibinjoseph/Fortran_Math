# MathFortran
Contains standalone code in Fortran for various general math algorithms written during my tenure at IIT Madras.

## Functions Implemented
 1. **length3d**  - Finds length of two points on 3d cartesian plane
 2. **linspace**  - Creates equispaced vector similar to Matlab linspace function
 3. **cosspace**  - Creates cosine-spaced vector
 4. **halfsinpace**  - Creates half sine-spaced vector
 5. **cross3**  - Cross product 
 6. **degtorad**  - Converts degree to radian (for code readability)
 7. **radtodeg**  - Converts radian to degree (for code readability)
 8. **outer_product** - Calculates outer product of two 3 dimensional vectors
 9. **inv**       - Calculates inverse of square matrix using Doolittle method
10. **isInverse**  - Verifies whether computed matrix is an inverse of given matrix
11. **print_mat** - Prints in neat matrix format
12. **rk4**       - Runge-kutta fourth order multi state diff. equation solver
