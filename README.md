 4. **halfsinpace**  - Creates half sine-spaced vector
 5. **cross_product**  - Cross product 
 6. **degtorad**  - Converts degree to radian (for code readability)
 7. **radtodeg**  - Converts radian to degree (for code readability)
 8. **outer_product** - Calculates outer product of two 3 dimensional vectors
 9. **getAngleTan** - Angle between two vectors using atan
 10. **getAngleCos** - Angle between two vectors using acos
 11. **unitVec** - Normalize a vector
 12. **projVec** - Project a vector along another vector
 13. **inv**       - Calculates inverse of square matrix using Doolittle method
 14. **isInverse**  - Verifies whether computed matrix is an inverse of given matrix
15. **print_mat** - Prints in neat matrix format
16. **norm** - Norm of a multi-dimensional vector
17. **lsq2** - Linear least squares fitting (2nd  order)
