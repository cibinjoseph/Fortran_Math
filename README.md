# MathFortran
Contains standalone code in Fortran for various general math algorithms written during my tenure at IIT Madras.

## Functions Implemented
1. **length3d**  - Finds length of two points on 3d cartesian plane
2. **linspace**  - Creates equispaced vector similar to Matlab linspace function
3. **cosspace**  - Creates cosine-spaced vector
4. **cross3**  - Cross product 
5. **degtorad**  - Converts degree to radian (for code readability)
6. **radtodeg**  - Converts radian to degree (for code readability)
7. **outer_product** - Calculates outer product of two 3 dimensional vectors
8. **inv**       - Calculates inverse of square matrix using Doolittle method
9. **print_mat** - Prints in neat matrix format
